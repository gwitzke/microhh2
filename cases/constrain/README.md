# CONSTRAIN Cold Air Outbreak case

## Case Description
This case is a Large Eddy Model intercomparison study of the CONSTRAIN cold air outbreak case. 
The CONSTRAIN CAO is a cold weather variant of Stratocumlus to Cumulus Transitions (SCTs) 
in which a cold stratocumumlus cloud deck is advected over an increasingly warmer sea surface temperature
(SST) resulting in a deepening of the boundry layer and the subsequent breaking up of the stratocumulus 
deck into a open-cell structured cumulus cloud field.
